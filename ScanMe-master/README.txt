ScanMe - Business card with offline anonymous Chatroom !

It is an Android app to digitalise some basic outdated methods.

App has a feature that will let a user exchange business cards with other users, thus eliminating the traditional way of exchanging physical business cards.

To send the business card, the app uses QR code, which a user can scan for other user and get the details, viz: First name, Last name, Email, Phone number.

Once scanned , there is a feature which saves the scanned users in the history.

There are two separate histories, which are Scanned users and got scanned by users.

This app also features clickable history, where you can click on a particular history and go directly and add/delete/edit it in the Contacts app of your phone.

In addition to the business app, this app also features a chatting facility between two users.
To use this app, the user does not require any internet connection as the app uses WIFIP2P facility, where users nearby can connect to each other using wifi.

To connect the two users, the app allows 2 ways to connect.
1. One way is to connect by checking the available connections, that uses a wifi connection and checks for nearby connections.
2. Other way is to scan the QR code and then the app asks to connect with the user.
    Using the second option gives you a confirmation that with exactly which user are you connecting.

Once deactivated with the user, all the chat history goes away. Hence the chat is secured and you don't need to worry about previous chats when the user is connected before.

In addition to anonymous chat, the app features a Find connection feature using "Siren". There is a button in the app when the users get connected.
When a user clicks "Make Sound", a siren will play in the other user's phone. The other user can then click "Stop Sound" to stop the Siren.

We know that a user in their lifetime might change City, Phone number. The app has facility to edit details : First name, last name, Phone Number, City.

To sign in, Email id is unique. The user cannot change its Email id once the user registers with the email id.
